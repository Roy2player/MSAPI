# MSAPI

MSAPI is a modular, high-performance C++ library for building Linux-based microservice and macrosystem architectures. It provides internal protocols, utilities, and server logic for efficient, scalable system development.

- ✅ Has no dependencies on third-party libraries.
- ✅ Is thoroughly documented.
- ✅ Is well covered by unit and end-to-end tests.

## 🔧 Building

To build library follow next simple steps:
```
cd library/build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
cmake --build . -j $(nproc)
```

***BUILD_PROFILE*** variable can be set to choose build type: Debug or Release.
See [CMakeListsCommonOptions.txt](library/build/CMakeListsCommonOptions.txt) for more details.

Number of bash scripts are available in the [bash/](bash/) folder to simplify building process. ***MSAPI_PATH*** variable should be set to the root of the MSAPI repository.

## 🧩 Features & structure:

### [Server Framework](library/source/server/)
- [**Server:**](library/source/server/server.h) Provides communication ability via TCP sockets and current-state model to manage server lifetime;
- [**Application:**](library/source/server/application.h) Provides customization ability via parameters and current-state model to manage application behavior.

Server provides data to be handled by calling a callback in case if this data is not a part of internal Application protocol.

### [Custom and another protocols](library/source/protocol/)
- [**Object protocol:**](library/source/protocol/object.h) Transfers simple copyable objects using stream and filter models.
- [**Standard protocol:**](library/source/protocol/standard.h) Handles dynamic-size messages as arrays of key-value pairs.
- [**HTTP protocol:**](library/source/protocol/http.h) Basic HTTP message parsing and handling.

### [Utility Modules](library/source/help/)
- [**Log:**](library/source/help/log.h) Multiple log levels and console/file outputs.
- [**Time:**](library/source/help/time.h) Time utilities and event scheduling.
- [**HTML:**](library/source/help/html.h) Parser module.
- [**JSON:**](library/source/help/json.h) Parser and producer module.
- [**Table:**](library/source/help/table.h) Data structure.
- [**Pthread:**](library/source/help/pthread.hpp) Module to synchronize threads.
- [**Bin:**](library/source/help/bin.h) Filesystem operations and helpers.
- [**Helper:**](library/source/help/helper.h) Miscellaneous utilities for common tasks.
- [**Meta:**](library/source/help/meta.hpp) Static enum translation, type helpers, and compile-time utilities.

### [Testing Framework](library/source/test/)

Unit/end-to-end tests utilities with ability to run servers as daemons.

## 🖥️ Frontend

[Manager app](apps/manager/source/manager.h) for orchestrating custom apps on the same host, with a user-friendly web interface.

Provides a robust and user-friendly interface for managing applications built on the framework.

- ***Web Interface:*** Manage applications through an intuitive, web-based UI.
- ***Installed Application Management:*** Automatically detect, register, and manage applications from a configuration file.
- ***Application Lifecycle Management:*** Create, modify, delete, run, pause, and monitor applications seamlessly.
- ***Dynamic Metadata Handling:*** Metadata is automatically generated by the C++ library and dynamically managed, ensuring the frontend loads only the relevant data when needed.
- ***Customizable Parameters:*** Modify application parameters with built-in validation and error handling.
- ***Real-Time Updates:*** Monitor application states and parameters in real time.
- ***Window Snapping:*** Drag and resize views with automatic snapping to other views or window borders.
- ***Logging Configuration:*** Customize logging options, including log levels, console/file output, and log file rotation by day.
- ***Error Handling:*** Provides mechanisms to handle invalid operations or configurations, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- ***Full Customization:*** Define each view using unique HTML templates on top of standardized structures, further customizable with CSS and extendable via JavaScript.
